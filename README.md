# Train-Time

This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Users can add trains by inputing the Train Name, Destination, First Train Time (in military time), and the Frequency of the train in minutes. JQuery is used to append new train data into the Firebase database. 

Users from any machine can view the same train times thanks to Firebase's realtime database and backend.
